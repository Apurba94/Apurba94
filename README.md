# Hi there, I'm Janin A Apurba 👋  

🚀 **Software Engineer | Competitive Programmer | AI/ML Engineer | Researcher **  

I am a Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a deep passion for solving problems through
 code. Over the past decade, I’ve immersed myself in competitive programming, which has sharpened
 my ability to think critically and design efficient algorithms. Alongside this, I’ve developed a strong
 interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision—areas where I’ve
 gained hands-on experience through academic projects and self-driven learning. I enjoy exploring how
 data and intelligent systems can solve real-world problems and am always looking for opportunities to
 grow, collaborate, and build meaningful technology
